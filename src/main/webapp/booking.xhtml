           can you please tell me why this is not working i could be wrong but i remember somewhere in your book 
            that if i use a commandLink we should use actionListener "Links implement actionSource2 interface that register 
            an actionEvent that is queued System Events  provide a precise way to observe the state of the jsf life cycle
           and are used by jsf to enable new features such as ajax - ed burns"
            <h:commandLink value="start booking" actionListener="guest/guest.xhtml"/> 
        </h:form>

        you need to take a look at the value of the attribute action of the <code><h:commandButton></code> tag.  
        This value is the name (ID) of our flow; after the window context is enabled, JSF will search the indicated 
        flow and navigate to the start node of the flow.  By default, the window context is disabled.
